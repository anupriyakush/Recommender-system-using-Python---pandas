# Recommender-system-using-Python---pandas

Wiki Definition of a recommender system is - A recommender system or a recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. 
I have used 100k dataset from movielens in this project. I have extensively used dataframes hence the clear choice of library is pandas. 
This project aims to predict the top five movies users will like based on their preference. I have used item based collaborative filtering because finding the relationship between items is better than finding relationship between people. I have established relationship between movies and based on the correlation, this code will suggest top five movies to consider watching.

I have tried to make this code well commented. Hope that helps explain the algorithm.
